This a school projet.

The goal is to produce a 2D depth image using greyscale value for the distance

It will communicate with an arduino through serial.
The arduino uses two servo and an ultrasonic sensor to scan in 3D.

If the main fail to run due to permission on the serial port,
run the "command.sh" in your terminal

This is mode using linux serial device

Calibration:
Start: 10 10
